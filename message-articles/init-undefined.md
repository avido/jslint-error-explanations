### When do I get this error?

The "It is not necessary to initialize '{a}' to 'undefined'" error is thrown
when JSLint, JSHint or ESLint encounters **a variable statement in which the
variable is explicitly initialised to `undefined`**. Here's an example in which
we attempt to declare a variable `x` and assign `undefined` to it:

<!---
{
    "linter": "jslint"
}
-->
```javascript
var x = undefined;
```

### Why do I get this error?

This error is raised to highlight a **completely pointless piece of code**. Your
code will run without error if you do not change it, but you're needlessly
increasing the size of your script. Since variable declarations are hoisted to
the top of the scope in which they occur, and assignments happen in the expected
place, variables are always initialized to `undefined` implicitly. The following
is what happens when you enter a new scope ([ES5 &sect;10.5][es5-10.5]):

> &zwnj;8. For each *VariableDeclaration... d* in source text order do<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Let *dn* be the *Identifier* in *d*.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Let *varAlreadyDeclared* be the result of calling
> *env's* HasBinding concrete method passing *dn* as the argument.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. If *varAlreadyDeclared* is false, then<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Call *env's*
> CreateMutableBinding concrete method passing *dn* and *configurableBindings*
> as the arguments.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Call *env's*
> SetMutableBinding concrete method passing *dn*, undefined, and *strict* as the
> arguments.

It's the last line that's interesting. Effectively, it creates a binding in the
current scope between the given identifier and the value `undefined`. This shows
that every variable has the value `undefined` when it is created. When the
variable statement is actually executed, it is assigned a value if an assignment
expression is present as part of the statement (as it is in our example above).
This is further clarified by the following ([ES5 ยง12.2][es5-12.2]):

> Variables are initialised to undefined when created. A variable with an
> *Initialiser* is assigned the value of its *AssignmentExpression* when the
> *VariableStatement* is executed, not when the variable is created.

You can fix the error by simply removing the assignment expression from the
variable statement. The variable will still have the same value:

<!---
{
    "linter": "jslint"
}
-->
```javascript
var x;
```

If, for whatever reason, you *have* to assign the `undefined` value to the
variable, you can replace `undefined` with something that returns the
`undefined` value. The simplest example of that is the `void` operator (although
as of September 2013 JSLint will raise a new error for this):

<!---
{
    "linter": "jslint"
}
-->
```javascript
var x = void 0;
```

In JSHint 1.0.0 and above you have the ability to ignore any warning with a
[special option syntax][jshintopts]. The identifier of this warning is **W080**.
This means you can tell JSHint to not issue this warning with the `/*jshint
-W080 */` directive.

In ESLint the rule that generates this warning is named `no-undef-init`. You can
disable it by setting it to `0`, or enable it by setting it to `1`.
